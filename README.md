# NanOrgan

Originally one-day coding project to test RtMidi and Portaudio by a quick implementation of a software synthesizer for organ sounds. For sample audio, see [Small Fugue](http://vsr.name/smallfugue_freeverb2.mp3) (Sequenced by Tirol at [Tirol's MIDI Works](http://tirolmusic.blogspot.fi/2007/10/fugue-in-g-minor-bwv578-little.html)).

Current version of NanOrgan is tailored to be used with my Akai MPK261 for control of the amplitudes of individual harmonics with the sliders.
